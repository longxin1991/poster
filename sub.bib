abstract = {Longitudinally polarized precursors to ScS phases observed in the Shikoku and Chugoku districts, southwestern Japan, are interpreted as ScSp arrivals, resulting from ScSto-P conversions at a dipping interface in the upper mantle. An ScSp phase recorded in the Tohoku district, northeastern Japan, also is examined. The location of the conversion interface, beneath the Shikoku district, determined from the ScSp observations agrees with the upper boundary of the descending Philippine Sea plate inferred from the seismicity pattern of subcrustal earthquakes. It has been proposed on the basis of no seismic activity in the upper mantle that the leading edge of the downgoing Philippine Sea plate has not reached the upper mantle beneath the Chugoku district. The ScSp observations, however, present a possibility of the existence of an aseismic continuation of the Philippine Sea plate in the upper mantle beneath the Chugoku district. An alternative interpretation of the conversion interface may be possible. The interface inferred in the present study may correspond to a boundary between the asthenosphere and an aseismic dead slab which had descended from the Nankai trough at the previous cycle of plate convergence. This ScS-to-P conversion interface may be closely related to the late Quaternary volcanism in the Chugoku district. Low-velocity zones are required in the vicinity of the inclined ScS-to-P conversion interfaces in the upper mantle beneath southwestern and northeastern Japan in order to explain the observed relative polarity between the ScSp and ScS phases. The first-order discontinuity of the velocity contrast of about 6\%, which has been suggested between the lithosphere and overlying asthenosphere, cannot simultaneously explain all of the observed amplitudes, periods, and polarity of the ScSp phases. The simplest model which explains these observations is the low-velocity zone with the sharp upper and transitional lower boundaries. This low-velocity zone may be related to the melting or dehydration of the oceanic crust which has been subducted with the underlying lithospheric plate. The ScS-to-P conversion interface inferred beneath southwestern Japan is more transitional than that beneath northeastern Japan. This difference in nature of the conversion interfaces must correspond to the difference in geological histories of both the regions. A high dip angle of the Philippine Sea plate in the Kyushu district and a low dip angle for the Shikoku district suggest that the normal-faulting subcrustal earthquakes beneath the Bungo channel and Iyonada, the western part of the Sevo Inland Sea, can be explained in terms of tearing and hinge faulting at the junction of the two slabs with different dip angles.},

abstract = {Detection of shallow slow earthquakes offers insight into the near-trench part of the subduction interface, an important region in the development of great earthquake ruptures and tsunami generation. Ocean-bottom monitoring of offshore seismicity off southern Kyushu, Japan, recorded a complete episode of low-frequency tremor, lasting for 1 month, that was associated with very-low-frequency earthquake (VLFE) activity in the shallow plate interface. The shallow tremor episode exhibited two migration modes reminiscent of deep tremor down-dip of the seismogenic zone in some other subduction zones: a large-scale slower propagation mode and a rapid reversal mode. These similarities in migration properties and the association with VLFEs strongly suggest that both the shallow and deep tremor and VLFE may be triggered by the migration of episodic slow slip events.},

abstract = {New high-resolution P- and S-wave tomography of the United States upper mantle from the Pacific Coast to the Great Plains reveals strong multi-scale heterogeneity closely correlated with tectonic and magmatic activity. We invert teleseismic travel-time residuals from the EarthScope Transportable Array and more than 1700 additional temporary and permanent stations for 3-D velocity perturbations to a depth of 1000 km. The inversion uses recent advances in western U.S. crust models to better isolate the mantle component of travel-time residuals, and frequency-dependent 3-D sensitivity kernels to map travel-time residuals, measured in multiple frequency bands, into velocity structure. In addition to separate VP and VS models, we jointly invert the two datasets for VP/VS perturbations by imposing a smoothness constraint on the $\delta$lnVS/$\delta$lnVP field. The joint inversion helps us identify regions where partial melt is probable. The amplitude of VP, VS, and VP/VS variations is greatest in the upper 200 km of the mantle and the form of velocity anomalies suggests a provincially heterogeneous lithosphere and the occurrence of widespread small-scale convection. Partially molten mantle is inferred beneath Yellowstone and the eastern Snake River Plain (SRP), the Salton Trough, and the Clear Lake volcanic field. The inferred depth extent of partial melt is consistent with a generally hydrated upper mantle and elevated temperatures beneath the eastern SRP and Yellowstone. Despite continuous subduction since the Cretaceous, the distribution of sub-lithospheric high-velocity anomalies is dissected (similar to other recent studies). Based on our new tomography models, western U.S. geologic history, and plate–tectonic reconstructions, we infer patchy and incomplete removal of the flat-subducting Laramide slab and slab tearing associated with Eocene accretion in the northwestern U.S.},

abstract = {A laboratory analogue of a three-layer linear viscous slab-upper mantle-lower mantle system is established in a silicone putty, honey and crystallized honey tank experiment. The same setup as in the numerical investigation (part 1) is used. We focus on the interaction of the slab with the induced passive mantle flow by widely varying the mantle volume flux boundary conditions. In our numerical experiments the lateral volume flux was set to zero. In interpreting the results relative to the real Earth, the base of the box is taken as the bottom of the mantle convection system, while the lateral boundaries may be associated with the presence of other nearby slabs. Dynamic force equilibrium, assessed on the basis of an analytical review of forces, is described for four different phases: (1) the subduction initiation instability, (2) the accelerating dynamic free fall phase of the slab, (3) the dynamic interaction with the 660-km discontinuity, and (4) a final phase of steady state trench retreat. Phase 3 is an important feature not observed in the numerical experiments. This highly dynamic phase of interrupted trench retreat can therefore be attributed to boundary conditions on mantle volume flux. On the basis of integration constants of force equilibrium in phases 2 and 4 we identify two different classes of volume flux: one in which the lateral boundary can be considered open and the other class where it is “closed.” Closed boundary condition cases are obtained if any of the lateral box boundaries are 600 km away from the slab. Assuming a one-to-one relation between trench retreat and back arc spreading, enigmatic observations of episodic opening of back arc basins can be explained by our experimental observations.},

abstract = {We combine spatial variations of P- and S-wave speeds, 1000 fault plane solutions, and 6600 well-determined hypocenters to investigate the nature of subducted lithosphere and deep earthquakes beneath the Tonga back-arc. We show that perplexing patterns in seismicity and fault plane solutions can be accounted for by the juxtaposition of a steep-dipping Wadati-Benioff zone and a subhorizontal remnant of slab that is no longer attached to the actively subducting lithosphere. The detached slab may be from a previous episode of subduction along the fossil Vitiaz trench about 5 to 8 million years ago. The juxtaposition of slabs retains a large amount of subducted material in the transition zone of the mantle. Such a configuration, if common in the past, would allow the preservation of a primordial component in the lower mantle.},

@article{Espurt2008,
abstract = {We present lithospheric-scale analog models, investigating how the absolute plates' motion and subduction of buoyant oceanic plateaus can affect both the kinematics and the geometry of subduction, possibly resulting in the appearance of flat slab segments, and how it changes the overriding plate tectonic regime. Experiments suggest that flat subductions only occur if a large amount of a buoyant slab segment is forced into subduction by kinematic boundary conditions, part of the buoyant plateau being incorporated in the steep part of the slab to balance the negative buoyancy of the dense oceanic slab. Slab flattening is a long-term process (∼10 Ma), which requires the subduction of hundreds of kilometers of buoyant plateau. The overriding plate shortening rate increases if the oceanic plateau is large enough to decrease the slab pull effect. Slab flattening increases the interplate friction force and results in migration of the shortening zone within the interior of the overriding plate. The increase of the overriding plate topography close to the trench results from (1) the buoyancy of the plate subducting at trench and (2) the overriding plate shortening. Experiments are compared to the South American active margin, where two major horizontal slab segments had formed since the Pliocene. Along the South American subduction zone, flat slab segments below Peru and central Chile/NW Argentina appeared at ∼7 Ma following the beginning of buoyant slab segments' subduction. In northern Ecuador and northern Chile, the process of slab flattening resulting from the Carnegie and Iquique ridges' subductions, respectively, seems to be active but not completed. The formation of flat slab segments below South America from the Pliocene may explain the deceleration of the Nazca plate trenchward velocity.},

@article{Nakanishi1981,
abstract = {ScSp phases are examined with special reference to their amplitude variations over seismograph networks in the Japanese Islands. ScSp of relatively large amplitude are observed along the Pacific side of the Japanese Islands. Amplitude ratios of the ScSp with respect to ScS are explained in terms of ScS-to-P conversion at the upper boundary of a descending Pacific plate which dips at about 30° and whose seismic wave velocity is between 5 and 10 per cent higher than that of the surrounding mantle. Large-amplitude ScSp are observed at stations nearest the Kurile or Japan trench. The amplitude ratios of ScSp/ScS are found to decrease rapidly with distance inland from the trench. An estimate is made of the effects of sharpness of the conversion interface, the incident angle of ScS upon it, and lateral variations of anelasticity within the asthenosphere overlying the descending Pacific plate, upon the ScSp/ScS ratios. We show that the sharpness of the conversion interface is the dominant factor. This result implies that the nature of the ScS-to-P conversion interface varies with distance from the trench or equivalently with depth. The presence of a low-velocity zone in the vicinity of the conversion interface is inferred from the relative polarity between ScSp and ScS observed at the stations on the outermost side of north-eastern Japan.ScSp arrivals from shallower conversions at depths less than about 80 km, observed in central and south-western Japan, are also examined to elucidate the structure of the Philippine Sea plate descending beneath this region. A discussion is made on the correlations between dipping subcrustal seismicity and the ScS-to-P conversion interfaces. Except for the Chugoku region, the ScS-to-P conversion interfaces correlate well with the dipping subcrustal seismicity. Our ScSp observations indicate the presence of a dipping discontinuity in the uppermost mantle beneath the Chugoku region, where no subcrustal earthquakes have been detected.},

@article{Skinner2013,
abstract = {Abstract Flat slab subduction has been attributed to various causes including mantle wedge dynamics, overriding by the upper plate, age of the subducting plate, and subduction of anomalously thick oceanic crust. One often favored explanation for flat slabs is the subduction of buoyant features on the oceanic plate in the form of an aseismic-ridge or oceanic plateau. We show through plate tectonic reconstructions of the Marquesas, Tuamotu, and Austral plateau, assuming that features on the conjugate plate can be used as proxies for subducted bathymetric anomalies, that there is very little correlation between the subduction of such anomalies and historic zones of flat subduction in South America. It is apparent that subduction of a bathymetric anomaly need not lead to a flat slab and not all flat slabs are associated with the subduction of a bathymetric anomaly.},

@article{Fukao2013,
abstract = {A new P wave tomographic model of the mantle was constructed using more than 10 million travel times. The finite-frequency effect of seismic rays was taken into account by calculating banana-donut kernels at 2 Hz for all first arrival time data, and at 0.1 Hz for broadband differential travel time data. Based on this model, a systematic survey for subducted slab images was developed for the circum-Pacific; including the Kurile, Honshu, Izu-Bonin, Mariana, Java, Tonga-Kermadec, southern and northern South America, and Central America, arcs. This survey revealed a progressive lateral variation of the configuration of slabs along arc(s), which we interpret as an indication for successive stages of slab subduction through the Bullen's transition region with the 660 km discontinuity at the middle. We identified the four distinct stages: I - slab stagnant above the 660 km discontinuity; II - slab penetrating the 660 km discontinuity; III - slab trapped in the uppermost lower mantle (at a depth of 660–1000 km); and IV - slab descending well into the deep lower mantle. The majority of slab images are found to be either at Stage I or III, suggesting that Stages I and III are relatively stable or neutral and II and IV are relatively unstable or transient. There is a remarkable distinction for the deepest hypocentral distribution between slabs at Stage I and slabs at Stages II or III.},

abstract = {After more than 100 million years of subduction, only small parts of the Farallon plate are still subducting below western North America today. Due to the relatively young age of the most recently subducted parts of the Farallon plate and their high rates of subduction, the subducted lithosphere might be expected to have mostly thermally equilibrated with the surrounding North American mantle. However, images from seismic tomography show positive seismic velocity anomalies, which have been attributed to this subduction, in both the upper and lower mantle beneath North America. We use a three-dimensional kinematic thermal model based on the Cenozoic plate tectonic history to quantify the thermal structure of the subducted Farallon plate in the upper mantle and determine which part of the plate is imaged by seismic tomography. We find that the subducted Farallon lithosphere is not yet thermally equilibrated and that its thermal signature for each time of subduction is found to be presently detectable as positive seismic velocity anomalies by tomography. However, the spatially integrated positive seismic velocity anomalies in tomography exceed the values obtained from the thermal model for a rigid, continuous slab by a factor of 1.5 to 2.0. We conclude that Farallon fragments that subducted since 50 to 60 Ma are still residing in the upper mantle and must be heavily deformed. The deformation of the slab in the transition zone is probably caused by the same mechanisms that were responsible for flat subduction around 60 Ma.},

abstract = {An increasing number of seismological studies indicate that slabs of subducted lithosphere penetrate the Earth's lower mantle below some island arcs but are deflected, or, rather, laid down, in the transition zone below others. Recent numerical simulations of mantle flow also advocate a hybrid form of mantle convection, with intermittent layering. We present a multi-disciplinary analysis of slab morphology and mantle dynamics in which we account explicitly for the history of subduction below specific island arcs in an attempt to understand what controls lateral variations in slab morphology and penetration depth. Central in our discussion are the Izu-Bonin and Mariana subduction zones. We argue that the differences in the tectonic evolution of these subduction zones—in particular the amount and rate of trench migration—can explain why the slab of subducted oceanic lithosphere seems to be (at least temporarily) stagnant in the Earth's transition zone below the Izu-Bonin arc but penetrates into the lower mantle below the Mariana arc. We briefly speculate on the applicability of our model of the temporal and spatial evolution of slab morphology to other subduction zones. Although further investigation is necessary, our tentative model shows the potential for interpreting seismic images of slab structure by accounting for the plate-tectonic history of the subduction zones involved. We therefore hope that the ideas outlined here will stimulate and direct new research initiatives.},

abstract = {The P wave velocity structure beneath the Western Pacific is found from the International Seismological Center first arrival data. Special attention was paid to the deep structure beneath the Wadati-Benioff zone. We discretized the whole mantle into blocks with finer blocks in the region of interest to obtain the velocities of all the blocks. This way of discretization minimizes a problem with tomographic studies of regional scale: difficulty in making corrections for the effects outside the region of interest. Our solution is iterative with the alternate step of the relocation of earthquakes, using the whole mantle model of Inoue et al. (1990) as a starting model. A first-order smoothness constraint was imposed to suppress the possible fluctuation of the solution around the initial model. The essential result depends little on whether the reference spherical model is smooth or discontinuous near 400- and 670-km depths. We examined the resolution by calculating the resolving kernels for selected blocks and by reconstructing the checkerboard test patterns of velocity perturbation and the test structures of subducting lithosphere. The resolution is depth dependent but in general good enough to see the slab configuration beneath the Southern Kurile-Japan-Izu-Bonin arcs and the Java arc. It is relatively poor beneath the Northern Kurile and Mariana arcs. The seismic image of subducting slab beneath the Southern Kurile to Bonin arcs bends to subhorizontal near the leading edge of the Wadati-Benioff zone and extends continentward over a distance of more than 1000 km. The subhorizontal portion of the slab connects a high-velocity blob to the bottom that reaches a depth of at least 800 km across the 670-km discontinuity under the Japan arc. Although the image of the Java slab directly penetrates the 670-km discontinuity, it then bends to a shallow dip with a considerable spread, reaching a depth of about 1200 km. These results suggest that descending slabs of lithosphere in the Western Pacific tend to be stagnant in the transition zone under a subtle control of the 670-km discontinuity. Although stagnant slab materials eventually descend into the lower mantle, they no longer maintain their original configuration below the 670-km discontinuity.},

abstract = {We document our tomographic method and present a new global model of three-dimensional (3-D) variations in mantle P wave velocity. The model is parameterized by means of rectangular cells in latitude, longitude, and radius, the size of which adapts to sampling density by short-period (1 Hz) data. The largest single data source is ISC/NEIC data reprocessed by Engdahl and coworkers, from which we use routinely picked, short-period P, Pg, Pn, pP, and pwP data (for earthquakes during the period 1964∼2007). To improve the resolution in the lowermost and uppermost mantle, we use differential times of core phases (PKPAB − PKPDF, PKPAB − PKPBC, Pdiff − PKPDF) and surface-reflected waves (PP-P). The low-frequency differential times (Pdiff, PP) are measured by waveform cross correlation. Approximate 3-D finite frequency kernels are used to integrate the long-period data (Pdiff, PP) and short-period (P, pP, PKP) data. This global data set is augmented with data from regional catalogs and temporary seismic arrays. A crust correction is implemented to mitigate crustal smearing into the upper mantle. We invert the data for 3-D variations in P wave speed and effects of hypocenter mislocation subject to norm and gradient regularization. Spatial resolution is ∼100 km in the best sampled upper mantle regions. Our model, which is available online and which will be updated periodically, reveals in unprecedented detail the rich variation in style of subduction of lithospheric slabs into the mantle. The images confirm the structural complexity of downwellings in the transition zone discussed in previous papers and show with more clarity the structure of slab fragments stagnant in the transition zone beneath east Asia. They also reveal low wave speed beneath major hot spots, such as Iceland, Afar, and Hawaii, but details of these structures are not well resolved by the data used.},
