abstract = {Theoretical information on possible waves reflected from the terrestrial inner core is obtained from the partitioning of energy of P waves incident on its surface. The amplitudes of PKiKP and PKIIKP are compared with those of PKIKP for allowable density and rigidity contrasts. A similar comparison for PKJKP is made in order to show the dependence of its amplitude on Poisson's ratio in the inner core. The phase PKiKP is not likely to possess appreciable energy compared with PKIKP except at distances greater than 105°. Near the anticentre, PKIIKP may have an amplitude about half that of PKIKP observed in the neighbourhood of 140°. Some observations bearing on the PKiKP phase are discussed.},

abstract = {We have assembled a data set of PKKPdf−PKKPbc (PKKPdf−bc) and PKPPKPdf-PKKPbc differential traveltimes. This data set is used to study the Earth's uppermost inner core in the western hemisphere. Data from the eastern Pacific are recorded at the Canadian Yellowknife array and travel through the inner core twice, once perpendicular to the Earth's rotation axis and once parallel to the rotation axis. Our polar paths sample a similar region to paths from the South Sandwich Islands to Alaska, an important path geometry for inner core anisotropy studies. Our data set has the potential to be an independent source of information on the structure of the inner core, and to be a good supplement to past PKP studies. Differential time residuals (relative to isotropic inner core models) of up to several seconds are found. The differential traveltimes show significant scatter (up to 6 s) making it difficult to attribute them to inner core anisotropy alone. Alternatively, strong heterogeneity in the inner core and along the mantle paths may contribute to observations.},

abstract = {We investigate the importance of wide-band coupling of normal modes due to inner core anisotropy. We compare four different seismic models of inner core anisotropy, which were obtained by others using the splitting of Earth's normal modes. These models have been developed using a self-coupling (SC) approximation, which assumes that coupling between nearby modes through anisotropic inner core structure is negligible. We test the SC approximation by comparing the frequencies and quality factors of 90 inner core sensitive modes, computed for these models using either the SC approximation or full-coupling (FC) among large groups of modes. We find significant shifts in the quality factors and frequencies for some modes. Groups of modes which significantly couple together are constructed for six target modes. These groups are model dependent and in some cases contain large numbers of modes. Synthetic seismograms are calculated to show that the difference between SC and FC is observable on the scale of seismograms and of the same order of magnitude as the difference between synthetic and observed seismograms. Thus, future models of inner core anisotropy should take cross-coupling between large groups of modes into account.},

abstract = {Seismic body waves that sample Earth's core are indispensable for studying the most remote regions of the planet. Traditional core phase studies rely on well-defined earthquake signals, which are spatially and temporally limited. We show that, by stacking ambient-noise cross-correlations between USArray seismometers, body wave phases reflected off the outer core (ScS), and twice refracted through the inner core (PKIKP2) can be clearly extracted. Temporal correlation between the amplitude of these core phases and global seismicity suggests that the signals originate from distant earthquakes and emerge due to array interferometry. Similar results from a seismic array in New Zealand demonstrate that our approach is applicable in other regions and with fewer station pairs. Extraction of core phases by interferometry can significantly improve the spatial sampling of the deep Earth because the technique can be applied anywhere broadband seismic arrays exist.},

abstract = {We apply a nonlinear waveform inversion method that we developed previously (Iritani et al., 2010, 2014) to broadband (0.02–2 Hz) core phase data recorded by global seismic arrays in order to investigate the frequency dependence of inner core attenuation. The results show a prominent difference of the frequency dependence of attenuation between the eastern hemisphere and the western hemisphere: while attenuation is frequency dependent in the western hemisphere, not so in the eastern hemisphere. Moreover, in the western hemisphere, a stronger frequency dependence of the attenuation is observed beneath Africa compared to beneath North America. This intricate quasi-hemispherical property of the frequency dependence of the inner core attenuation, together with the quasi-hemispherical variability of seismic velocity and attenuation strength at around 1 Hz that we reported earlier, can be consistently understood in terms of the relative location of the seismic observation frequency band and the absorption band peaks that are different for regions. The variability of the absorption band peak may reflect the variability of the iron grain size of the inner core: the grain size is larger in the eastern hemisphere than the western hemisphere, and in the western hemisphere beneath North America, it gradually increases with depth. However, caution should be taken in this inference as the physical mechanism of attenuation in the inner core is still poorly constrained both theoretically and observationally.},

abstract = {Spectral ratios of short-period core phases with common source and receiver and with nearly the same ray paths in the mantle have been formed to derive a Q-structure for 1 Hz compressional waves in the inner core. Data from one large array (NORSAR) have been used to extract the relevant phases, including the pairs (PKIKP, PKiKP), (PKIKP, PKP(BC)), (PKIIKP, PKiKP), (PKIIKP, PKKP(BC)). An array is needed in particular to separate PKIKP and PKiKP and to identify PKIIKP. In forming the spectral ratios, techniques like spectraforming and instantaneous spectral analysis have been employed. The data have been inverted using a number of different velocity models. The essential features of the resulting Q-models are the same: Q rises from a value of about 200 near the inner core boundary to about 600 at 400 km depth penetration. Below 450 km depth the Q-structure is not well constrained, but probably is below a value of 2000. It is suggested that the temperature at the inner core boundary is close to the melting point of iron and that partial melting occurs in at least part of the inner core. The low Q-structure greatly affects the amplitudes of phases like PKIIKP and PKJKP. It is verified that PKIIKP is observable only in exceptional cases and arguments are presented that PKJKP is too small to be observed.},

@article{Souriau1989,
abstract = {The first part of this article gives new travel-time data for the phase PKiKP at subcritical distances ($\Delta$ < 110°) obtained at the Warramunga array in Northern Australia. A compilation of the PKiKP subcritical travel times obtained from previous studies has also been carried out. In the second part, differential PKiKP-PcP travel times at short distances ($\Delta$<45°) are used to determine the inner core ellipticity and mean radius, subject to hypotheses on the equilibrium figure of the liquid core and the topography of the core-mantle boundary (CMB). The coherence of the PKiKP-PcP travel-time residuals is increased when Morelli \& Dziewonski's CMB topography is taken into account. According to various hypotheses, the values obtained for the ellipticity range from (1.9±2.2)×10−3 to (5.6±1.7)×10−3. This denotes a small inner core flattening corresponding to a decrease of the polar radius from (1.6±1.8) to (5.0±1.5) km with respect to a spherical inner core. The preferred solutions which involve the CMB topography, are consistent with the ellipticity 2.43×10−3 deduced from hydrostatic equilibrium of a rotating inner core. The last part of the paper concerns the amplitude variations of PKiKP. The amplitude ratio PKiKP/PcP at short distances ($\Delta$<45°) is used to constrain the density jump $\delta$$\rho$ at the inner core boundary. $\delta$$\rho$ values of 1.35–1.66 g cm−3 are obtained for a quality factor in the liquid core ranging from 10 000 to infinity. These values, as well as a possible stratification in the inner core, are in favour of an inner core composition which is not pure iron.},

abstract = {PKP-Cdiff is a compressional wave diffracting around the inner core boundary (ICB), which may contain much information on the structure of the ICB. Here I have determined the slowness of PKP-Cdiff and its coda with small-aperture arrays to approach the unsettled issues on the origin of PKP-Cdiff coda. Short-period seismic array data were analyzed using beam forming as function of slowness and back azimuths. The analysis was applied to band-pass filtered array records for 16 frequency bands with central values of 0.25–4.0 Hz. The difference of array response functions were adjusted by using the phase weighted stack with large power indexes of the phase stack. The stacking analysis resulted in enough slowness resolution in the higher frequency range of 1–4 Hz, PKP-Cdiff coda was identified as an assembly of coherent signals. PKP-Cdiff coda lasted longer than the duration of PKP-AB, suggesting that PKP-Cdiff coda is independent of source time function and/or site effects. The slowness of PKP-Cdiff coda was distributed from 1 to 5 s/deg with blunt peaks at 2, 3 and 4 s/deg, whereas those of PKP-DF and PKP-AB were relatively concentrated in narrow ranges around 1–2 and 4–5 s/deg, respectively. The slowness larger than 2 s/deg and travel times of the PKP-Cdiff coda can be explained by scattering of PKP waves near the caustic at the core-mantle boundary (CMB). Especially, the slowness of the scattering waves from the source side CMB is close to that from the ICB and it is difficult to distinguish them. In order to obtain secure observations of PKP-Cdiff coda from the ICB, we better avoid analyzing an event that is located over strong heterogeneities at the CMB.},

abstract = {Differential rotation of the Earth′s inner core has been predicted in some geodynamo models, and seismic studies over the past 15 yr have resolved rotation rates up to 1°yr−1. Most previous seismic body-wave studies have focussed on South Sandwich Islands events recorded at station COL in Alaska. Here, we present a globally extended study into temporal variations in the inner core over some 25 yr, using PKPbc-PKPdf traveltime residuals. To test for differential rotation of the inner core, displacement of inner-core heterogeneities over time is sought. We introduce a new method of space-flattening to remove the effect of spatial variations on the time variations; this allows for the use of both polar, semi-equatorial and equatorial geometries. First, we reanalyse polar paths from South Sandwich Islands events to stations COL and INK in North America. These stations yield a differential rotation of the inner core at a rate of 0.12–0.38°yr−1 in an eastward direction, in agreement with previous studies. However, station DAWY, which has a very similar path through the inner core as COL, yields at best a westward differential rotation of the inner core. Thus DAWY results are incompatible with the COL/INK inferred rotation. Secondly, earthquakes in the Aleutian Islands region, observed at BOSA and LBTB in southern Africa, exhibit temporal variations that are incompatible with the South Sandwich Islands-COL/INK inferred rotation rate. Thirdly, Kuril Islands events, recorded in South America at station BDF, yield inconclusive results. Finally, our final piece of evidence for the irreconcilability of differential inner-core rotation with global data comes from using earthquakes in the Vanuatu region, recorded at BCAO/BGCA in Central Africa, an equatorial geometry. These residuals resolve a westward inner-core rotation at a rate of 0.14°yr−1, over the same time period that South Sandwich Islands events indicate an eastward rotation. As any rigid-body rotation should yield the same direction and rate independent of where the inner core is sampled, our results allow us to reject previously reported inner-core differential rotation rates of up to 0.1–0.5°yr−1. Instead, our results suggest that structure in either the inner or the outer core is varying with time, over relatively short timescales and in ways that cannot be explained by, and do not support, a differentially rotating inner core.},

abstract = {Abstract Lateral heterogeneities at the top of the inner core are investigated using earthquakes that occurred in Indonesia and southeast Asia and were recorded in the southeastern Caribbean. Using seismic observations of attenuation and seismic velocity, we were able to constrain the characteristics of the boundary between the inner and outer core to further investigate the dynamics and evolution of the Earth’s core. Our seismic observations from core phases confirm that the outermost inner core is asymmetrically heterogeneous and we are able to further constrain the morphology and physical properties of this layer. Comparison of data from earthquakes with ray paths traversing from east to the west versus those with ray paths from west to east allow us to map the aspherical heterogeneity of the boundary layer and specifically image the boundary between the proposed quasi-eastern and western hemispheres of the inner core. The variation of differential travel times between \{PKPdf\} and PKPbc, attenuation in terms of Q factor, and latitudinal changes for both of these observations, can be attributed to localized heterogeneity at the quasi-hemispherical boundaries of the inner core. We constrain the change in the thickness of outermost core boundary layer from 100 to 250\&\#xa0;km within a distance of a few 10s of kilometers at 45°E\&\#xa0;±\&\#xa0;2°, for the western boundary, with an overall P-wave velocity decrease in the western hemisphere of 0.5\% and increase of 0.5\% in the eastern hemisphere. We constrain the eastern boundary at latitudes greater than 45°N to 173°E\&\#xa0;±\&\#xa0;4° with an overall P-wave velocity decrease in the western hemisphere of 1.0\% in the uppermost 200\&\#xa0;km of the inner core. The eastern boundary at equatorial latitudes is constrained to a region \&lt;170°E with a western hemisphere with a 0.5\% drop in P-wave velocity in the uppermost 250\&\#xa0;km. },

abstract = {The GRF (Gr\"{a}fenberg) seismic array in Germany is located at epicentral distances immediately before the PKP caustic B generated by underground nuclear explosions on the French atolls Mururoa and Fangataufa in the South Pacific. I use the large-amplitude PKP waveforms to improve the locations of underground explosions near these French atolls. The core phases are investigated using theoretical seismograms calculated with an extended reflectivity method. Near the caustic range, the waveforms are strongly distance dependent due to a rapid decrease in PKPdiff amplitudes before the caustic B. On the basis of their different slownesses, beam-forming and velocity-spectral (vespagram) analyses are used to identify PKPdiff, PKIKP, and PKiKP, which arrive within a few seconds of each other. Amplitudes and travel times of the weak secondary arrivals PKIKP and PKiKP are measured from the corresponding beams using a matched-filter technique. Theoretical seismograms show a change in the amplitude ratio PKIKP/PKPdiff by a factor of 2 for explosions separated by 30 km. This distance-dependent amplitude ratio is tested as a discriminant for closely spaced explosions using 31 Mururoa and five Fangataufa events. On average, the observed amplitude ratios agree with the theoretically expected amplitude-ratio behavior with distance. A combined analysis of travel time and amplitude data indicates that the investigated Mururoa explosions were detonated beneath a relatively large area of the atoll (ca. 80\%), whereas on Fangataufa, explosion epicenters were concentrated within a small portion of the island. This finding contrasts the ISC/PDE epicenter determinations, which, due to insufficient station coverage, locate the majority of the explosions outside of the rim of the atolls.},

abstract = {Abstract The structure of Earthʼs deep inner core has important implications for core evolution, since it is thought to be related to the early stages of core formation. Previous studies have suggested that there exists an innermost inner core with distinct anisotropy relative to the rest of the inner core. Using an extensive new data set of handpicked absolute travel time observations of the inner core phase PKIKP, we find that the data are best explained by variations in anisotropy between two hemispheres and do not require an innermost inner core. We demonstrate that observations of an innermost inner core are an artifact from averaging over lateral anisotropy variations. More significantly we show that hemispherical variations in anisotropy, previously only imaged in the upper inner core, continue to its centre. The eastern region has 0.5–1.5\% anisotropy, whereas the western region has 3.5–8.8\% anisotropy increasing with depth, with a slow direction at 57–61° to the Earthʼs rotation axis at all depths. Such anisotropy is consistent with models of aligned hcp or bcc iron aggregates.},

We present evidence for significant temporal variability in the amplitude of the inner core reflected phase PKiKP for an exceptionally high-quality earthquake doublet, observed postcritically at the short-period Yellowknife seismic array (YK), which occurred in the South Sandwich Islands within a 10-year interval (1993/2003). This observation, complemented by data from several other doublets, indicates the presence of topography at the inner-core boundary, with a horizontal wavelength on the order of 10 km. Such topography could be sustained by small-scale convection at the top of the inner core and is compatible with a rate of super rotation of the inner core of \^{a}0.1\^{a}0.15\^{A}° per year. In the absence of inner-core rotation, decadal scale temporal changes in the inner-core boundary topography would provide an upper bound on the viscosity at the top of the inner core.},

Furthermore, other seismological evidence, some of it pre-existing and some of it very recently discovered, militates against these models. Within the framework of isotropic earth models there appears to be no acceptable explanation of the modal observations. Here we show that anisotropy in the inner core can produce an effect which is of the correct magnitude and which varies from mode to mode in approximately the observed manner. The data currently available are insufficient to objectively map the anisotropy, but the simple assumption of a constant elastic tensor which is invariant under rotations about the Earth's rotation axis (i.e. is transversely isotropic in the plane of the equator) matches well the gross features of the modal observations. This model does not entirely reconcile the modal data with traveltime observations; it is argued, however, that there exists an anisotropic model which will do so.},

Variation of S-wave velocity between the polar axis and equatorial plane is more sensitive to the addition of liquid than that of P waves. The liquid could arise from the presence of dendrites or a mixture of elements other than iron that exist in liquid form under inner-core conditions.},

There are apparently no first-order discontinuities in the transition region from the outer to the inner core, as proposed earlier by other authors. The P velocity increase at the inner core boundary is 0.6–0.7 km/sec and thus considerably less than that in standard core models. In the outermost part of the inner core, there is a pronounced P velocity gradient. The S velocity below the inner core boundary is 3–4 km/sec, and thus this study gives another piece of purely seismological evidence for solidity of the inner core. Precursors to the main core phases in short-period records, which are frequently observed, are not explained by the proposed core model. Scattering hypotheses for the origin of these arrivals are compatible with the results of this study.},

Its elastic anisotropy is now well established, and has been shown to vary spatially. There is a well defined hemispherical dichotomy in anisotropy and attenuation, and significant variations in the radial direction, with weaker anisotropy in the uppermost regions, and possibly different properties in an “innermost inner core” of radius 300–600\&\#xa0;km. Perhaps even more puzzling is the observation of a stably stratified layer at the base of the outer core, which has recently been proposed to result from melting of inner core material. If confirmed, the presence of this layer has major implications for our understanding of convection in the outer core. Inner core differential rotation with respect to the mantle remains controversial. We will review here recent progress in understanding the dynamics of the inner core. A number of different models have been proposed for the development of the inner core's structure and formation of the stable layer at the base of the outer core, and particular care will be taken to clarify under which conditions the proposed mechanisms can be active.},

This anisotropy has previously been explained by a preferred orientation of the iron alloy hexagonal crystals. However, hexagonal iron becomes increasingly isotropic on increasing temperature at pressures of the inner core and is therefore unlikely to cause the anisotropy. An alternative explanation, supported by diamond anvil cell experiments, is that iron adopts a body-centered cubic form in the inner core. We show, by molecular dynamics simulations, that the body-centered cubic iron phase is extremely anisotropic to sound waves despite its high symmetry. Direct simulations of seismic wave propagation reveal an anisotropy of 12\%, a value adequate to explain the anisotropy of the inner core.},

We employ two separate anelastic treatments: (i) fully anelastic measurement, in which a complete set of anelastic splitting function coefficients is measured in addition to the elastic coefficients, and (ii) zonal anelastic measurement, in which anelasticity is only allowed in zonal splitting function coefficients. Together, these two approaches confirm that normal modes sensitive to the Earth’s inner core resolve zonally dominant elastic and anelastic structures. The zonal dominance of anelasticity suggests that the inner core exhibit cylindrical attenuation anisotropy in addition to cylindrical velocity anisotropy. In particular, the zonally dominant anelasticity correlates with zonal elastic structure, that is, directions of higher velocity in the inner core also appear more attenuating.},

We demonstrate that this behaviour is coherent, and that the characteristics associated with these data are still those of transverse isotropy. We also perform a systematic search for the location of the symmetry axis. Results suggest that the axis may be significantly tilted away from the geographic pole; however, higher-quality data are required to draw a firm conclusion. Inversion of the data with the symmetry axis at the geographic pole yields a model of anisotropy that is considerably different from that of the inner-core between 300 and 1220\&\#xa0;km radius. These observations imply that there is a seismically distinct region at the centre of the Earth with radius of about 300\&\#xa0;km.},

The array beam detected a P onset, with the correct slowness, within 2 sees of the theoretical travel time. The ground amplitude is 3 + 1 millimicrons at a dominant period of 1.5 sec. By comparison, the PKiKP ground amplitude from Faultless is 75 millimicrons at a dominant period of 1.1 sec. This detection again confirms the sharpness of the inner core boundary and the 1968 core travel times for PKiKP. The additional attenuation of PKIIKP over PKiKP yields, from direct and spectral measurements, Q = 4 5 0 + 1 00 for P waves in the inner core. This value sharpens the earlier estimates of I. Sacks, G. Buchbinder, A. Qamar, and A. Eisenberg and is almost independent of core structure and rigidity. On the assumption of a constant velocity in the inner core, the observed differential PKIIKP minus PKiKP travel time requires an average P velocity of 11.4 + 0.02 km/sec for an inner core radius of 1216 km.},

Recorded at permanent Global Seismic Network (GSN) and temporary SSCUA deployment broad-band seismographic stations in Antarctica, the new data improve the previously poor and biased coverage that underlies the seismic constraints on recent models of inner core structure and anisotropy. On the one hand, new differential PKP traveltime measurements improve the sampling of predominantly the eastern inner core hemisphere. PKPab-df and PKPbc-df differential traveltime residuals, with respect to the spherically symmetric model ak135, are consistently smaller than two seconds along the north-south paths sampled. Axially symmetric models of inner core seismic anisotropy with fast axis parallel to the Earth's rotation axis require a weak anisotropy of (0.7 \{+/-\} 0.1) per cent to be consistent with our PKPbc-df observations. PKPbc-df residuals from the quasi-eastern hemisphere indicate (0.4 \{+/-\} 0.1) per cent anisotropy. If only PKPbc-df observations from the top 200 km of this hemisphere are considered, this is reduced to (0.1 \{+/-\} 0.2) per cent, consistent with an isotropic layer. On the other hand, new absolute PKP traveltime measurements add to the sampling of both hemispheres of the inner core, but it is difficult to use them with more confidence to assess structure of the core since they are affected by crustal and mantle structure and source uncertainties. The newly collected data set also increases constraints on D" structure beneath the South Pole. In contrast to previous inferences based on data from northern stations, we find no evidence of a velocity heterogeneity in the outer core near the inner core boundary associated with the cylinder tangent to the inner core in the southern hemisphere.},

abstract = {We investigate one-dimensional waves in a standard linear solid for geophysically relevant ranges of the parameters. The critical parameters are shown to be T*= tu/Qm where tu is the travel time and Qm the quality factor in the absorption band, and $\tau$-1m, the high-frequency cut-off of the relaxation spectrum. The visual onset time, rise time, peak time, and peak amplitude are studied as functions of T* and $\tau$m. For very small $\tau$m, this model is shown to be very similar to previously proposed attenuation models. As $\tau$m grows past a critical value which depends on T*, the character of the attenuated pulse changes. Seismological implications of this model may be inferred by comparing body wave travel times with a ‘one second’ earth model derived from long-period observations and corrected for attenuation effects assuming a frequency independent Q over the seismic band. From such a comparison we speculate that there may be a gap in the relaxation spectrum of the Earth's mantle for relaxation times shorter than about one second. However, observational constraints from the attenuation of body waves suggest that such a gap might in fact occur at higher frequencies. Such a hypothesis would imply a frequency dependence of Q in the Earth's mantle for short-period body waves.},

abstract = {Studies of velocity structure in the Earth's inner core and its volumetric variations illuminate our understanding of inner core dynamics and composition. Here we use an extensive number of seismograms recorded by the Hi-net array to construct complete empirical curves of PKPBC-PKPDF differential traveltimes. The nature of these curves implies that significant variations in traveltimes are accumulated during the passage of PKPDF waves through the uppermost inner core and rules out outer core structure effects. Uniform cylindrical anisotropy of a plausible strength in the uppermost inner core can also be ruled out as a cause of the observed traveltime variations because the range of sampled ray angles is too narrow. The configuration and strength of inhomogeneities from a recent tomographic model of the lowermost mantle cannot account for the observed traveltime variations. Therefore, we infer that either variations of P wave isotropic velocity on the scale of about hundred km and less are present in the uppermost inner core or the material may be organized in distinctive anisotropic domains, and both of these features may be superimposed on long-wavelength hemispherical structure. If the former holds true, the absolute magnitude of required P wave velocity perturbations from referent values is 0.60 ± 0.10\% in the quasi-eastern and 1.55 ± 0.15\% in the quasi-western hemisphere (0.85 ± 0.05\% and 1.10 ± 0.10\%, respectively, with the lowermost mantle correction). The existence of these variations is a plausible physical outcome given that vigorous compositional convection in the outer core and variations in heat exchange across the inner core boundary may control the process of solidification.},

Here we present observations of the phases pPKJKP and SKJKP for the Flores Sea event of 1996 June 17. The observations support the value of approximately 3.6 km s(-1) for the inner core shear wave velocity and open up new possibilities for exploring the anisotropic structure and the attenuation properties of the inner core. The analysis and validation of the observation is based on a new method that can be used in the search for and identification of inner core shear waves. In this method normal mode synthetics for a solid inner core are compared with those for a fluid inner core. It is only by such comparisons that it is possible to be certain that inner core shear waves, rather than interferences of other phases, are responsible for observed energy maxima in stacked seismic records.},

abstract = {We propose an extension of the model by Yoshida et al., 1996 where deformation in the inner core is forced by preferential growth in the equatorial belt, by taking into account the presence of a stable compositional stratification. Stratification inhibits vertical motion, imposes a flow parallel to isodensity surfaces, and concentrates most deformation in a shallow shear layer of thickness ∼B−1/5, where B is the dimensionless buoyancy number. The localization of the flow results in large strain rates and enables the development of a strong alignment of iron crystals in the upper inner core. We couple our dynamical model with a numerical model of texture development and compute the time evolution of the lattice preferred orientation of different samples in the inner core. With sufficient stratification, texturing is significant in the uppermost inner core. In contrast, the deeper inner core is unaffected by any flow and may preserve a fossil texture. We investigate the effect of an initial texture resulting from solidification texturing at the ICB. In the present inner core, the deformation rate in the shallow shear layer is large and can significantly alter the solidification texturing, but the solidification texture acquired early in the inner core history can be preserved in the deeper part. Using elastic constants from ab initio calculations, we predict different maps of anisotropy in the modern inner core. A model with both solidification texturing and subsequent deformation in a stratified inner core produces a global anisotropy in reasonable agreement with seismological observations.},

abstract = {Calculations for short-period body waves that interact with an inner-outer core transition of finite thickness are described. This involves development of a hybrid full wave-reflectivity algorithm which is used to calculate synthetic seismograms for earth models with various transition thicknesses. The numerical results indicate that the frequency content of reflected short-period PKiKP waveforms observed at distances less than 40 deg is very sensitive to the thickness of the transition zone. Comparison with published data in this distance range indicates that the inner-core transition must be less than 5 km thick. In the distance range 60-90 deg effective decoupling of short-period PKiKP and PKJKP is achieved for transition zones as thin as 3 km, resulting in substantial distortion of the PKiKP waveform. PKIKP + PKiKP waveforms in the distance range 120-130 deg are not as sensitive to the detailed properties of the transition, but the signal quality is good enough to constrain the transition thickness to be less than 10 km.},

abstract = {The determination of the inner-core boundary structure is key to understanding the mechanisms of inner-core growth, iron solidification and anisotropy formation in the inner core. A waveform inversion of a worldwide data set of PKIKP and PKiKP core phases is performed to investigate the velocity and the attenuation structure of this region. The data set is chosen to sample the top 50 km of the inner core. Two inversion methods combining time and frequency domain observations are presented. Synthetic tests are performed in order to evaluate the resolution and the confidence intervals of the model parameters. The attenuation of P waves in the uppermost inner core is poorly resolved but appears to be high (Q < 100). The uppermost inner-core interface is divided into two regions: a region extending from 180\{degrees\}W to 60\{degrees\}E and characterized by negative P-wave velocity perturbations (dV/V < 0 per cent), and a region extending from 60\{degrees\}E to 180\{degrees\}E and characterized by positive P-wave velocity perturbations (dV/V [\~{}]1 per cent). The results of the inversion do not favour the presence of transverse isotropy aligned along the spin axis of the Earth in the uppermost inner core for these two regions. However, these regions are correlated with those where large-scale variations of the inner-core anisotropy have been determined previously in the deeper inner core, 100 km beneath the inner-core boundary.},

Such variations indicate that Earth’s ICB is irregular, with a combination of at least two scales of topography: a height variation of 14 km changing within a lateral distance of no more than 6 km, and a height variation of 4–8 km with a lateral length scale of 2–4 km. The characteristics of the ICB topography indicate that small-scale variations of temperature and/or core composition exist near the ICB, and/or the ICB topographic surface is being deformed by small-scale forces out of its thermocompositional equilibrium position and is metastable.},

The spectrum of relaxation times is chosen so as to model a constant Q medium within an absorption band covering a broad frequency range which may be chosen so as to include the seismic frequencies. The inverse transform may be evaluated asymptotically in the limit of very long propagation times using the saddle point method. For shorter propagation times the method of steepest descent may be modified so as to yield an accurate first motion approximation. The character of the small amplitude precursor to the large amplitude ‘visible’ signal is investigated analytically.

@article{Souriau1996,
abstract = {During the last decade, the presence of velocity anisotropy inside the inner core, with a fast axis parallel to the Earth's rotation axis, has been well established. The quantitative analysis of the amplitudes of waves which sample a particular region of the inner core, under Africa, but exhibit various orientations allows us to document and characterize the presence of anisotropy in attenuation. The analysis is based on a comparison of both amplitudes and travel times of the PKP(DF) wave, which samples the inner core, and the PKP(BC) wave, which has nearly the same path but bottoms inside the liquid core. The data reveal that the direction of strong attenuation correlates with that of fast velocity. When referred to the same epicentral distance and focal depth, the PKP(DF)/PKP(BC) amplitude ratio are about five times lower for paths tilted by 25° with respect to the Earth rotation axis, than for nearly equatorial paths. A clear negative correlation is observed between travel time and amplitude residuals, when the angle to Earth rotation axis varies. This first quantitative analysis, combined with experimental results on oriented crystals and mushy media, may bring important constraints on the mechanism responsible for anisotropy in the inner core.},

abstract = {Hypotheses for the mechanisms of growth of Earth's inner core can be tested from observations of lateral variations of elastic and anelastic properties near the inner core boundary. Differential travel times of PKIKP-PKiKP and the apparent travel time of P waves diffracted around the inner core are consistent with the existence of a stably stratified, globally uniform, region of reduced velocity gradient at the bottom of the outer core. This layer may be a zone of iron enrichment relative to the bulk of the outer core, representing a zone either of crystallization or melting of the inner core. Weak backscattered PKiKP in the equatorial eastern hemisphere can be made consistent with either a hypothesis of freezing or melting. In a melting hypothesis, the eastern hemisphere is texturally older and smoother, with larger crystals or smaller elastic contrasts across grain boundaries providing weaker backscatter to the coda of PKiKP. Additional observations consistent with higher homologous temperature and melting in this region are the existence of a thin low velocity layer in the uppermost inner core inferred from multipathing of PKIKP + PKiKP waves and a bright spot in the amplitude of PKIIKP waves observed at antipodal distances. Alternatively, a freezing hypothesis in the eastern hemisphere is an inner core that is growing radially outward with crystals stretched in the vertical direction. This hypothesis can simultaneously explain weak backscattered PKiKP coda and high attenuation of transmitted PKIKP from the loss of backscattered energy at angles perpendicular to vertically oriented crystals. Strong backscattering observed in the coda of PKiKP sampling the equatorial western hemisphere of the inner core agrees best with a heterogeneity having an isotropic distribution of scale lengths in the uppermost inner core.

abstract = {Body waves interacting with the boundary of the solid inner core at narrow and wide angles of incidence provide independent constraints on a heterogeneous texture that may originate from the process of solidification. The equatorial, quasi-eastern hemisphere, of the uppermost 50–100 km of the inner core is characterized by a higher isotropic P wave velocity, lower Q$\alpha$'s inferred from PKIKP, and simpler PKiKP pulses compared to adjacent regions in the western hemisphere and polar latitudes. Compared to this region, the adjacent western (primarily Pacific) equatorial region is characterized by higher Q$\alpha$'s and a higher level of coda excitation following PKiKP. Lateral variations in both inner core Q$\alpha$ inferred from transmitted PKIKP and inner core heterogeneity inferred from the coda of reflected PKiKP can be modeled by lateral variations in a solidification fabric. In an actively crystallizing eastern equatorial region, characterized by upwelling flow in the outer core, fabrics that explain strong attenuation and the absence of attenuation and velocity anisotropy in short range (120°–140°) PKIKP and weak PKiKP codas have an anisotropy of scale lengths with longer scale lengths in the vertical direction, perpendicular to the inner core boundary. In less actively solidifying regions in the equatorial western hemisphere, longer scale lengths tend to be more parallel to the inner core boundary, consistent with outer core flow tangent to the inner core boundary or viscous shearing and recrystallization in the horizontal direction away from more actively crystallizing regions in the eastern hemisphere. This texture is less effective in attenuating PKIKP by forward scattering. Lateral variation in the equatorial western hemisphere between vertical versus horizontal oriented plate-like textures may explain lateral variations from weak to strongly back-scattered PKiKP coda and from strong to weak velocity and attenuation anisotropy in short range PKIKP.},

abstract = {The structure of the Earth's inner core is not well known between depths of ∼100–200 km beneath the inner core boundary. This is a result of the PKP core phase triplication and the existence of strong precursors to PKP phases, which hinder the measurement of inner core compressional PKIKP waves at epicentral distances between roughly 143 and 148°. Consequently, interpretation of the detailed structure of deeper regions also remains difficult. To overcome these issues we stack seismograms in slowness and time, separating the PKP and PKIKP phases which arrive simultaneously but with different slowness. We apply this method to study the inner core's Western hemisphere beneath South and Central America using paths travelling in the quasi-polar direction between 140 and 150° epicentral distance, which enables us to measure PKiKP–PKIKP differential traveltimes up to greater epicentral distance than has previously been done. The resulting PKiKP–PKIKP differential traveltime residuals increase with epicentral distance, which indicates a marked increase in seismic velocity for polar paths at depths greater than 100 km compared to reference model AK135. Assuming a homogeneous outer core, these findings can be explained by either (i) inner core heterogeneity due to an increase in isotropic velocity or (ii) increase in anisotropy over the studied depth range. Although this study only samples a small region of the inner core and the current data cannot distinguish between the two alternatives, we prefer the latter interpretation in the light of previous work. },

abstract = {The seismic phase PKiKP, reflected from the inner core, and its coda give information on the short scale heterogeneities at and below the inner core boundary (ICB) of the Earth. We have collected PKiKP recorded at short distances (<45°) at broadband stations in Australia and at the Warramunga seismic array (WRA). Despite potential complications from a dual-passage through D″, PKiKP is frequently observed on single traces in the frequency band 1–5Hz. PKiKP usually has a sharp onset, but sometimes its waveforms have multiple pulses separated by times of the order of 1s. At WRA, the coda of PKiKP initially decays very rapidly after the main pulse. Thereafter, its amplitude is nearly constant and more than three times smaller than PKiKP with duration longer than 200s. Our observations differ from those of [Nature 404 (2000) 273–275], at rather greater distances, who found that the coda is larger than PKiKP and increases slowly. We suggest that the PKiKP coda is generated near the inner core boundary by complex reverberation effects, rather than scattering through the volume of the inner core.},

abstract = {The seismic structure of Earth's inner core is highly complex, displaying strong anisotropy and further regional variations. However, few seismic waves are sensitive to the inner core and fundamental questions regarding the origin of the observed seismic features remain unanswered. Thus, new techniques to observe different types of inner core waves are imperative to improve data coverage. Here, we detail our method for detecting exotic inner core phases such as PKJKP and PKIIKP, using inner core compressional waves as proof of concept. We use phase weighted stacking on long period data from a global distribution of stations, and employ several synthetic methods, including normal mode summation and SPECFEM, to identify and confirm the inner core phases. We present evidence for two observations of exotic inner core compressional waves, and apply the technique to a previously detected inner core shear wave. A possible new inner core shear wave remains unconfirmed. Additionally, we show how our method is important for rejecting potential observations, and distinguishing between waves with similar traveltime and slowness. The method is most successful for detecting exotic inner core compressional waves, and will provide a new approach for studying the compressional wave structures in the upper inner core. },

Such boundaries could be caused by changes in the strength and orientation of anisotropy, by variations in the fraction of partial melt or by a solid—solid phase transition involving iron. In this work, we search for evidence of IC discontinuities with reflection seismology techniques that use precritical PKiKP waveforms as empirical source pulses. Because any phase reflected from an IC discontinuity will have a small amplitude, we develop a technique combining source and receiver stacks in the search. We perform resolution tests where we compare the data with synthetic waveform stacks created using generalized ray theory and appropriate attenuation operators. Our results show that the IC lacks a significant (impedance jump >3 per cent), sharp (thickness <3–4 km), global discontinuity to depths of 800 km below the boundary with the outer core.},

abstract = {Long-period PKP amplitudes from 16 earthquakes in the distance range 110– 170° are compared with theoretical amplitudes which are derived from synthetic seismograms calculated for 56 systematic modifications of Earth model 1066B in the inner core. A suitable normalization procedure allows for the common representation of all observed amplitudes as a function of epicentral distance. Using the theoretical amplitude distributions it can be shown that the parameters of a regression line through the logarithmic and normalized amplitudes between 110 and 134° are related to the velocity and density jump at the inner-core boundary (ICB). The analysis shows that the dominant influence on the PKP amplitudes is the P-velocity jump which can be restricted to 0.64 ± 0.05 km s−1. There exists a trade-off between the S-velocity jump and the density jump. Restricting the latter to the reasonable range 0–1.2 g cm−3 the S-velocity jump at the ICB can be inferred to be 2.5–3.0 km s−1. A rather strong S-velocity gradient below the ICB follows from the condition that the S-wave travel-time through the inner core agrees with that implied by free oscillation observations. This leads to central S-velocities between 3.81 and 4.15 km s−1, assuming a parabolic velocity law.},

The front separates the warm and cold regions in the core and includes a narrow jet flowing from the core-mantle boundary to the inner-core boundary.

Forward modeling with the reflectivity method suggests that the best-fit velocity structures in the Eastern and Western hemispheres are 0.5\% faster and 0.9\% slower, respectively, than an average structure at the inner core boundary (ICB), and that the velocity perturbations become linearly closer to the average with depth, finally coinciding with the average at 400\&\#xa0;km and 250\&\#xa0;km below the ICB, respectively, if ak135 is adopted for the structure above the ICB. In the Eastern hemisphere, the Q values in the uppermost 250\&\#xa0;km of the inner core and that in the range from 300 to 450\&\#xa0;km below the \{ICB\} are approximately 180 and 1000, respectively.

Here, we use a large data set of PKIKP/PKiKP amplitude ratios to derive attenuation models for the upper 100 km of the inner core, incorporating the effects of velocity models calculated using the same data set. We confirm that the upper inner core is hemispherical in attenuation, with stronger attenuation in the east hemisphere. We also observe, for the first time, a low attenuation upper layer of approximately 30 km thickness throughout the top of the inner core. Attenuation increases beneath this layer, and then gradually decreases going deeper into the inner core. Although the data appear to show attenuation anisotropy below 57.5 km depth in the west, we find that this can be explained by the velocity models alone, with no requirement for attenuation anisotropy in the upper inner core.},

abstract = {We have measured both the differential travel times and the amplitude ratios of core phases PKP(DF) and PKP(BC), observed on digital broadband records worldwide, and analyzed them jointly, in order to try and distinguish between the effects of lateral heterogeneity and anisotropy in the inner core, and to test different hypotheses on the possible origin of such anisotropy. For the best quality data, we observe a correlation between stronger attenuation and faster velocities on a global scale, confirming earlier results obtained beneath Africa. Regional variations are observed in this relationship. In addition, for paths which have their turning point in equatorial regions, both the velocity and attenuation show clear dependence on the angle $\Theta$ of the ray path in the inner core with the Earth's rotation axis. By contrast, for paths with turning points at higher latitudes, this dependence is apparent only in the travel times. The ray azimuth at its turning point, computed in a reference system with a slightly tilted symmetry axis with respect to the Earth's rotation, appears to be a more successful parameter for analyzing anisotropy. The velocity-attenuation correlation suggests that crystal orientation is responsible for both the travel time and attenuation anisotropy, and that the heterogeneity level inside the inner core must be small. However, in order to investigate the pattern of anisotropy in more detail, simple models expressed in terms of $\Theta$ alone are no longer adequate, and more complex parametrization, possibly related to convective processes, will have to be considered.},

@article{Tkalcic2015,
abstract = {The days when the Earth's inner core (IC) was viewed as a homogenous solid sphere surrounded by the liquid outer core (OC) are now behind us. Due to a limited number of data sampling the IC and a lack of experimentally controlled conditions in the deep Earth studies, it has been difficult to scrutinize competitive hypotheses in this active area of research. However, a number of new concepts linking IC structure and dynamics has been proposed lately to explain different types of seismological observations.A common denominator of recent observational work on the IC is increased complexity seen in IC physical properties such as its isotropic and anisotropic structure, attenuation, inner core boundary (ICB) topography, and its rotational dynamics. For example, small-scale features have been observed to exist as a widespread phenomenon in the uppermost inner core (UIC), probably superimposed on much longer-scale features. The characterization of small-scale features sheds light on the nature of the solidification process and helps understanding seismologically observed hemispherical dichotomy of the IC. The existence of variations in the rate and level of solidification is a plausible physical outcome in an environment where vigorous compositional convection in the OC and variations in heat exchange across the ICB may control the process of crystal growth. However, further progress is hindered by the fact that the current travel time data of PKIKP waves traversing the IC do not allow discriminating between variations in isotropic P-wave velocity and velocity anisotropy. Future studies of attenuation in the IC might provide crucial information about IC structure, although another trade-off exists - that of the relative contribution of scattering versus viscoelastic attenuation and the connection with the material properties. Future installations of dense arrays, cross-paths of waves that sample the IC, and corresponding array-studies will be a powerful tool to image and clearly distinguish between viscoelasticand scattering attenuation, and isotropic- and anisotropic-heterogeneity related effects on travel times of core-sensitive body waves. This will then inevitably contribute to a better understanding of what the IC is made of, how it solidifies and how it contributes to the generation and dynamics of the geomagnetic field.},

abstract = {The inner core of the Earth has been interpreted as being elastically anisotropic, with the direction parallel to the rotation axis fast. There are also observations that north–south rays exhibit greater amplitude reduction and more complex waveforms. In previous work, we found that directionally solidified, polycrystalline, tin (Sn)-rich alloys exhibit a solidification texturing that is measurable ultrasonically, and suggested that such texturing might be a cause for the observed seismic elastic anisotropy. Here, we find that zinc (Zn)-rich alloys also exhibit a measurable elastic anisotropy that is due to a preferred growth direction. We confirm the grain orientation by back-reflection X-ray diffraction. Zn solidifies as a hexagonal closest-packed (hcp) metal, albeit one with a c/a ratio greater than the ideal, unlike hcp iron (Fe), and is 60\% elastically anisotropic. We also find that the columnar dendritic grains that grow with a preferred orientation during directional solidification result in anisotropic scattering off grain boundaries, yielding an anisotropic apparent attenuation. In addition, we present results for directionally solidified 100\% Zn, which exhibits qualitative differences in both the elastic and attenuation anisotropy from Zn alloys. The laboratory results can be interpreted as a cause for both the seismic elastic and attenuation anisotropy if the cooling near the inner core has more nearly cylindrical than spherical symmetry.},

abstract = {Short-period seismograms are synthesized for PKP phases in anelastic Earth models. The synthetics were constructed using a synthetic technique valid at grazing incidence, a source-time function appropriate for deep-focus earthquakes, and an instrument response for either a short-period WWSSN or SRO seismograph. The agreement between predicted and observed amplitudes and spectral ratios requires neither a low-Q$\alpha$ zone at 0.2–2 Hz nor a low or negative P-velocity gradient at the bottom of the outer core. Thin low-Q$\alpha$ zones beneath the inner core boundary fit spectral ratio data that sample the upper 200 km of the inner core but fail to fit data that sample the lower inner core. Only a model having Q$\alpha$−1 ϵ[0.003, 0.004] at 0.2–2 Hz, nearly constant with depth in the inner core, satisfies all of the spectral ratio and amplitude data. The assumption of a bulk viscosity of 10-103 Pa s for the liquid phase of a partially molten inner core combined with the observation of low shear attenuation in the inner core at frequencies less than 0.005 Hz limit the physical parameters associated with two possible attenuation mechanisms: (1) fluid flow and viscous relaxation due to ellipsoidally shaped inclusions of melt, and (2) the solid-liquid phase transformation induced by the stress change during the passage of a seismic wave. Both mechanisms require an order of 0.1\% partial melt to reproduce the observed Q$\alpha$−1. In the outer core, the time constant of the mechanism of phase transformation is predicted to be 104–106 s. Confirmation of small shear attenuation in the inner core in the frequency band of seismic body waves would favor the mechanism of phase transformation.},

abstract = {Abstract Differential travel times and waveforms of \{PKIKP\} and \{PKiKP\} phases in the 129°–141° distance range, deconvolved for the effects of source time functions and average mantle attenuation operators, are inverted for velocity and attenuation in the uppermost 80 km of the inner core, and the velocity gradient and attenuation in the lowermost 200 km of the outer core (F region). Results confirm degree-one velocity structure in the inner core whose fast and slow regions appear to be separated by transitions with a velocity contrast of about 1\%. Although attenuation in the inner core also exhibits degree-one pattern, a high attenuation region ( Q p − 1 = [ 0.002 , 0.0067 ] ) extends to the central Pacific, which has been previously considered a part of the western hemisphere characterized by slower velocity and lower attenuation. The rest of the inner core exhibits a positive correlation between velocity and attenuation as observed previously. An observed mantle-like relationship between velocity and attenuation in the central Pacific can be interpreted as originating from higher than average homologous temperature, consistent with a model of inner core solidification driven by outer core convection coupled to core–mantle boundary thermal heterogeneity. Alternative mechanisms, including differences in grain size and impurity concentration, and lateral differences in solidification rate might be required to explain the structure of the inner core. The F region velocity and attenuation are best explained by the AK135-F velocity model and Q p − 1 = [ 0 , 0.001 ] respectively.},

We demonstrate that transverse isotropy with a symmetry axis parallel to the rotation axis produces splitting of the form delta omega(m), = omega(a' + c'm(2) + dm(4)), where m denotes the azimuthal order of a specific singlet within a given multiplet with degenerate eigenfrequency omega; the scalars a', c', and d represent the effects of transverse isotropy on a particular normal mode, The effect of a tilt in the anisotropic symmetry axis relative to the axis of rotation can be easily incorporated and leads to non-zonal splitting.},

Based on an extensive seismic data set, we propose the existence of an innermost inner core, with a radius of ∼300 km, that exhibits a distinct transverse isotropy relative to the bulk inner core. Specifically, within the innermost inner core, the slowest direction of wave propagation is ∼45° from the east-west direction. In contrast, the direction of the slowest wave propagation in the overlying inner core is east-west. The distinct anisotropy at the center of the Earth may represent fossil evidence of a unique early history of inner-core evolution.},

Reflectivity synthetics with one-dimensional random velocity fluctuations are compared with observations of PKP(DF)/PKP(Cdiff) amplitude ratios and differential travel times of PKP(Cdiff)-PKP(DF) for the equatorial paths. A Gaussian distribution of P-wave velocity fluctuations with the standard deviations of 5\%, 6\%, and 7\% in the uppermost 200 km of the inner core is superimposed on the velocity structure that is slightly faster than the typical structure in the Eastern Hemisphere, which is likely to explain both the travel time and amplitude data as far as only the one-dimensional structure is considered. Further examinations of the statistic characteristic of scatterer distribution in two and three-dimensions are required to obtain a realistic conclusion.},

@article{Deguen2007,
abstract = {It has been suggested about 20 years ago that the liquid close to the inner core boundary (ICB) is supercooled and that a sizable mushy layer has developed during the growth of the inner core. The morphological instability of the liquid–solid interface which usually results in the formation of a mushy zone has been intensively studied in metallurgy, but the freezing of the inner core occurs in very unusual conditions: the growth rate is very small, and the pressure gradient has a key role, the newly formed solid being hotter than the adjacent liquid. We investigate the linear stability of a solidification front under such conditions, pointing out the destabilizing role of the thermal and solutal fields, and the stabilizing role of the pressure gradient. The main consequence of the very small solidification rate is the importance of advective transport of solute in liquid, which tends to remove light solute from the vicinity of the ICB and to suppress supercooling, thus acting against the destabilization of the solidification front. For plausible phase diagrams of the core mixture, we nevertheless found that the ICB is likely to be morphologically unstable, and that a mushy zone might have developed at the ICB. The thermodynamic thickness of the resulting mushy zone can be significant, from ∼100 km to the entire inner core radius, depending on the phase diagram of the core mixture. However, such a thick mushy zone is predicted to collapse under its own weight, on a much smaller length scale (≲1 km). We estimate that the interdendritic spacing is probably smaller than a few tens of meter, and possibly only a few meters.},

abstract = {The phase PKIIKP, which is once reflected from the underside of the inner core boundary, was detected at LASA for a large Novaya Zemlya event at an epicentral distance of 63°. The detection was verified by a technique similar to the VESPA process. Clear arrivals for the phases PcP, P2KP, P4KP, and P7KP were also observed. The near-side reflection PKiKP was unfortunately not observed for this event, but it is nevertheless possible to estimate the compressional velocity in the upper half of the inner core by using the differential PKIIKP-PcP travel time. Using this single observation, we estimate the average velocity in the outer half of the inner core to be 11.0 km/sec. This number changes by less than 0.1 km/sec for variations in inner core radius from 1215 to 1230 km, for possible errors in the observed differential times of several seconds, and for reasonable differences in the outer core velocity model (Gilbert et al., 1973, vs. Jordan, 1972).

The depth of the earthquake foci varies between 116 and 625 km. The phases of interest are PKP(BC branch) and PKIKP with bottoming depths in the upper few hundred kilometers of the inner core. The data consist of high-quality digital data at sampling rates 2040 samples per second selected after an extensive search of the 1985–1986 GDSN event tapes for short-period P waves with a high signal-to-noise ratio. The results are based primarily upon observations between distances of 147° and 154°. Useful information regarding the attenuation characteristics of the region below the inner core boundary (ICB) can be obtained from the observed relative amplitude and frequency content of the PKIKP and PKP(BC) phases. We have used Fourier spectral ratios of PKIKP-PKP(BC) for the estimation of the attenuation along the inner core segment of the ray path. Because of the limited frequency band of the data, it is difficult to resolve any frequency dependence for Q. Within the depth range of 150–300 km below the inner core boundary, the data yield a maximum likelihood estimate of 175 for the mean estimate of Q$\alpha$, with no clear indication of depth dependence.},

abstract = {To constrain the elastic structure of the Earth's inner core, we have picked the differential times of 879 core-penetrating body waves from vertical-component, short-period seismograms recorded by global and regional seismic networks. Using a cross-correlation technique, we measure the difference in arrival times of P′BC-P′DF and P′AB-P′DF where the P′DF (PKIKP) phase penetrates the inner core, while both the P′BC (PKP-BC) and P′AB (PKP-AB) phases bottom in the outer core. P′BC-P′DF times for paths that are nearly parallel to the Earth's spin axis are consistently 2–4 s larger than predicted using the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM), while rays in other directions have a mean and standard deviation of 0.2 ± 0.4 s. P′AB-P′DF times, which correspond to P′DF rays turning deeper in the inner core, are 3–6 s for rays nearly parallel to the spin axis and 0.3 ± 0.9 s for rays not near the spin axis. These observations lead to the robust conclusion that the inner core is strongly anisotropic. The level of anisotropy in our model is about 3\% at a radius of 1000 km (depth of 200 km) and increases to about 4\% at a radius of about 700 km. Below this radius, our resolution is poor, but the anisotropy appears to weaken. Resolution is also weak in the outer 200 km of the inner core, but the anisotropy appears to diminish in this region as well. A simple model of hexagonally symmetric anisotropy aligned with the spin axis explains 74\% of the variance. The symmetry direction which fits the data the best and explains 79\% of the variance is at 80°N, 120°E. The locus of directions which explain 70–79\% of the variance includes only 4\% of the possible range of directions, and includes the spin axis direction. The observed anisotropy is most likely due to preferred alignment of elastically anisotropic crystals. We propose several new alignment mechanisms and all viable mechanisms seem to be associated with a strong toroidal magnetic field. An outstanding problem that requires further investigation is that first-principles calculations of seismic anisotropy of hexagonal close packed (hcp) iron suggest that anisotropy of order 3\% is predicted. Thus, 100\% alignment could go a long way towards explaining our observations, but seems highly unlikely.},

@article{Beghein2003,
abstract = {A technique for searching full model space that was applied to measurements of anomalously split normal modes showed a robust pattern of P-wave and S-wave anisotropy in the inner core. The parameter describing P-wave anisotropy changes sign around a radius of 400 kilometers, whereas S-wave anisotropy is small in the upper two-thirds of the inner core and becomes negative at greater depths. Our results agree with observed travel-time anomalies of rays traveling at epicentral distances varying from 150 degrees to 180 degrees. The models may be explained by progressively tilted hexagonal close-packed iron in the upper half of the inner core and could suggest a different iron phase in the center.},

@article{Rost30112001,
abstract = {Data from earthquakes in the Tonga-Fiji region recorded at a seismic array in northern Australia show evidence for rigid zones at the top of the outer core. The ScP waveforms can be modeled by thin (0.12 to 0.18 kilometer) zones of molten iron mixed with solid material with a small, but positive, S-wave velocity (0.6 to 0.8 kilometer per second) that enables the propagation of S-waves in the outermost core. The zones may be topographic highs of the core-mantle boundary filled by light core sediments and might be important for variation of Earth's nutation and for convection of the outer core.},
